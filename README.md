Venue - Wise IPL 2023 Analysis 

This project analyzes IPL 2023 matches using the Pandas library. The code reads ball-by-ball records and match details, merges the datasets, and calculates statistics related to player performance, match phases, over-wise, and venue-wise aggregates. 

Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sankha1998/ipl2023

The above dataset had 2 files, one containing the ball-to-ball analysis while the other file containing match results.

Further insights :

The analysis was done a day before the World Cup Final 2023. In the recent past, ODI cricket has become an extended version of T20 cricket. 
A deeper analysis of the venue of the final was done before the day of the final.

The analysis included the phase-wise comparison of runs scored and wickets taken in 3 phases of the game namely powerplay, middle, and death for both innings separately.

Also, over-by-over analysis was done in the same manner for both innings separately.

The average score of the team batting first was more than the team batting second.
Also, the number of wickets lost by the team batting first is less than the team batting second.

A graph is being plotted with the help of matlplotlib which shows the runs per over for both the innings which further proves batting first is preferred over batting second.
